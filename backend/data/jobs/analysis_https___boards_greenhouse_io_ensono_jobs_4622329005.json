Our Associates focus on client impact with curiosity and a feeling of relentless commitment.&nbsp; About the role and what you will be doing At Ensono, we’re transforming into a&nbsp; software-first Managed Services Provider , where AI/ML and automation move us from reactive firefighting to predictive, zero-touch operations . Our Envision Operating System is the platform that makes this shift possible—bringing together data, intelligence, and automation across mainframe, distributed, and cloud environments. &nbsp; As a Machine Learning Engineer (ML Engineer) , you’ll be the builder who takes models from notebooks to production systems . You’ll work side-by-side with Data Scientists to translate their predictive insights into scalable, high-performance solutions that can run reliably at enterprise scale. &nbsp; This is a role for makers —people who thrive at the intersection of code, models, and operations. You’ll design APIs, deploy services, and ensure our AI capabilities integrate seamlessly with systems like ServiceNow , Snowflake, and Envision. Your work ensures that incident predictions, anomaly detections, and optimization recommendations don’t just exist in theory—they power real-time operations, reduce downtime, and drive measurable business outcomes for our clients. &nbsp; If you’re the kind of engineer who loves making AI actually work in production and want to be part of the team that’s rewiring managed services with intelligent automation , this role is for you. &nbsp; Key Responsibilities &nbsp; Model Deployment – Productionize machine learning models built by Data Scientists, ensuring they run reliably, securely, and at scale. API &amp; Service Development – Design APIs and services that expose model predictions to EnvisionOS, ServiceNow, and other enterprise systems. Performance Optimization – Tune models for latency, throughput, and cost efficiency in real-time environments. Feature Pipeline Integration – Collaborate with Data Engineers to ensure robust feature pipelines feed models consistently and with minimal drift. Automation &amp; Scaling – Use containers, orchestration, and CI/CD practices to automate deployment and monitoring of models. Cross-functional Collaboration – Work with Ops, Data Science, and MLOps to ensure models deliver actionable, explainable outcomes that drive trust and adoption. &nbsp; Required Skills &amp; Experience &nbsp; Strong programming skills in Python (must-have) plus C, C++, Java, Javascript for performance-critical applications. Experience with&nbsp; ML frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn. Hands-on experience with&nbsp; Docker, Kubernetes, or other container orchestration tools. Familiarity with&nbsp; Snowflake and data engineering workflows for integrating feature pipelines. Experience deploying models in production and exposing them through&nbsp; REST APIs, Flask, or Streamlit . Knowledge of SnowFlake is beneficial Strong understanding of&nbsp; model optimization, hyperparameter tuning, and inference performance . Experience working with&nbsp; ServiceNow or IT operations datasets is highly desirable. &nbsp; Mindset &amp; Values &nbsp; Get Stuff Done – You take pride in moving models out of slides and into production. Builder at Heart – You see APIs, services, and pipelines as products that should be reliable, elegant, and scalable. Impact-Oriented – You measure success by uptime improvements, cost savings, and real-world adoption of AI-driven workflows. Collaborative Engineer – You bridge the gap between Data Scientists and Ops teams, speaking both “ML” and “production.” Continuous Improver – Always looking for ways to make models faster, cheaper, and more accurate. &nbsp; &nbsp; Success Looks Like &nbsp; Models running in production pipelines , integrated with ServiceNow and EnvisionOS. Predictions that&nbsp; Ops teams trust and act on , reducing downtime and improving MTTR. Automated deployment workflows that keep models fresh, monitored, and reliable. AI capabilities that scale across&nbsp; mainframe, distributed, and cloud infrastructure seamlessly. &nbsp; Benefits We believe that great work deserves great rewards. In return for your ideas, commitment and ambition, we’ll give you a very competitive base salary and a range of benefits as soon as you join. On top of your highly competitive base salary, we offer:&nbsp; Flexible and remote work opportunities Performance bonus Training and development programs Worldwide career opportunities Community outreach and mentoring opportunities Le",
